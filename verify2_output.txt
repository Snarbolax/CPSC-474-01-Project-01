
Assumptions
===========
1. The network is fully connected.
2. A broadcast is a send event with more than two receive events.
3. Each send event is followed by one or more receive events.
4. A process has only one receive event associated with a send event executed at another process.
5. There is no receive event without a send event that has happened at a different process earlier in the execution.
6. There are 1 < n < 6 processes possible per matrix.
7. There are less than 25 maximum events possible per process.
8. There are at most 9 send events possible per matrix.
===========

Select input preference.
	1. Read user input (via terminal)
	2. File input
	3. Exit program

Input the number of processes (i.e. rows): 5
Enter the full name of a file to be analyzed (file must be in the same directory as executable) and hit enter: verify2.txt

Input file "verify2.txt" opened succesfully


Select the algorithm for the matrix to be used as an input for.
	1. Calculate (Lamport LC Values)
	2. Verify (Execution Correctness)
	3. Exit program
