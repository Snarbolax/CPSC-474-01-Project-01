
Assumptions
===========
1. The network is fully connected.
2. A broadcast is a send event with more than two receive events.
3. Each send event is followed by one or more receive events.
4. A process has only one receive event associated with a send event executed at another process.
5. There is no receive event without a send event that has happened at a different process earlier in the execution.
6. There are 1 < n < 6 processes possible per matrix.
7. There are less than 25 maximum events possible per process.
8. There are at most 9 send events possible per matrix.
